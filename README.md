# Car-Repairshop-DB

The chosen database management system models a car reparations company. The company has various customers, and each customer owns a car with a specific set of characteristics, like brand and color. These cars are the subjects of repair job requests, which contain a brief description about what needs to be repaired, as well as a time slot (start time and end time) for the repair job. Additionally, each request contains a list of the tools and ma- terials required for the repair job. Each repair job is assigned to a mechanic, where each mechanic has an assigned salary and works in a particular workshop. Each workshop has a maximum capacity of cars that can be handled at once, as well as a current capacity. Furthermore, each workshop has an inventory of tools and materials which are used to repair the cars.

The purpose of this database is to be able to effectively manage the repair job requests, and ensuring that the requests are allocated to workshops that contain enough space and the necessary inventory to complete the job.

Database is created for DTU 02170 Project
